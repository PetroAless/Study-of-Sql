--Sql, structured query language, programming language used to read, write and delete databases.
--It uses mysql in my example to read sql queries and execute the commands.
--using xampp obv

--Basic commands //there will be exercises later or notes after 2 slashes

--it is a best practice to write commands in all caps, and identifier's names being careful about the case sensitivity cuz sql is not case sensitive about commands but it is about id's

--Mysql software that translates sql in actions on the database





--SELECT, INSERT INTO ECC
--UPDATE:
--    changes the content of a field

    UPDATE tbl_name 
    SET column1=val1, column2=val2 ,...,columnN=valN
    WHERE 'condition';


--LIMIT OFFSET:

    --selects records with a certain offset and a certain number of records
    SELECT column_name
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    LIMIT number_of_records OFFSET numberToNotConsider;


--GROUP BY:
    -- groups rows by column



--JOINS
    --it's used to get records connected through a single column in common, (foreign key)
    --there are many Joins, the normal is the inner join, which returns the rows with the foreign key in common;
    --the left join returns the left table, and even the rows without a match 
    ex:                                                         LEFT JOIN!
+----+----------+--------+---------------------+
| ID | NAME     | AMOUNT | DATE                |
+----+----------+--------+---------------------+
|  1 | Ramesh   |   NULL | NULL                |
|  2 | Khilan   |   1560 | 2009-11-20 00:00:00 | eg:(Customer.ID = Orders.customer_ID)
|  3 | kaushik  |   3000 | 2009-10-08 00:00:00 |
|  3 | kaushik  |   1500 | 2009-10-08 00:00:00 |--can see there are 4 situations without a match so it fills with null
|  4 | Chaitali |   2060 | 2008-05-20 00:00:00 |--cuz the right table doesn't have any ID of the right table as value
|  5 | Hardik   |   NULL | NULL                |
|  6 | Komal    |   NULL | NULL                |
|  7 | Muffy    |   NULL | NULL                |
+----+----------+--------+---------------------+
    --RIGHT JOIN returns the right table, and even the rows without a match
    ex: the same as above, in case the right table has some Orders.customer_ID that are not present in Customer.ID
    --Full join mixes both joins
    

    --Union e union all are used to return 1 or more select without creating a new query and in the same table
    --union all returns even dubplicate rows
    

    --HAVING clause, is used cuz the WHERE keyword can't be used with functions like COUNT();

    --COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, SET TRANSACTION are all operations that help in mantaining the state of the db 
    --and work in many queries at the same time and execute them all together and are called TRANSACTIONS
    --COMMIT saves the state of the db in that exact moment used with:
    --ROLLBACK to "roll back" to the state committed
    --SAVEPOINT is used in the middle of the transactions between COMMITS to not rollback the whole transaction
    --SET TRANSACTION is used to give a name to the transaction


    --TEMPORARY TABLES, topic to be seen later (?) about tables that last as long as the mysql session is going

    end for now
