Sql, structured query language, programming language used to read, write and delete databases.
It uses mysql in my example to read sql queries and execute the commands.
//using xampp obv

Basic commands //there will be exercises later or notes after 2 slashes

//it is a best practice to write commands in all caps, and identifier's names being careful about the case sensitivity cuz sql is not case sensitive about commands but it is about id's
