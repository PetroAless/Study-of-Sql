Sql, structured query language, programming language used to read, write and delete databases.
It uses mysql in my example to read sql queries and execute the commands.
//using xampp obv

Basic commands //there will be exercises later or notes after 2 slashes

//it is a best practice to write commands in all caps, and identifier's names being careful about the case sensitivity cuz sql is not case sensitive about commands but it is about id's

Mysql software that translates sql in actions on the database

    WHERE 'condition';


SELECT TOP:
